notmuch-indicator
=================

This is a simple hack to integrate
[notmuch](http://www.notmuchmail.org/) into Ubuntu's
[Messaging menu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MessagingMenu). The script's
few configuration options can be found in its first few lines.

The searches created by `notmuch-indicator` are specified by the
`searches` option. These searches will be refreshed every
`poll_period` seconds (if not `None`) or every time `watch_file` (if
not `None`) is changed.
